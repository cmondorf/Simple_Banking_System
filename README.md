# Simple_Banking_System

A project from the Hyperskill Python track.

This one was useful as a way to get exposure to SQLite. The final stage of the project is made quite challenging by the need to perform different checks to see if a transfer between accounts is possible in such an order as to not ask for more information than is strictly necessary at any moment.
